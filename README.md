There are two main documents containing the scripts used to analyze the majority of the data in the SpyCI-LAMBS manuscripts. The ipynb is used to parse the selectivity data and do a cluster/correlational analysis. The qmd is used to relate the selectivity data with the phylogeny. These scripts apply packages in Python and R in standard ways. Please contact that authors of the SpyCI-LAMBS manuscript for additional details about how they used this code. The publication of this code is a public record of the analysis, rather than a standalone set of tools the reader may want to use for their own analysis.
